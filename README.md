Project: Youtube
Adview Prediction

Youtube advertisers pay content creators based on adviews and clicks for the
goods and services being marketed. They want to estimate the adview based
on other metrics like comments, likes etc. The problem statement is therefore
to train various regression models and choose the best one to predict the
number of adviews. The data needs to be refined and cleaned before feeding
in the algorithms for better results.

Objective

To build a machine learning regression to predict youtube adview count based
on other youtube metrics.


Data Description

The file train.csv contains metrics and other details of about 15000 youtube
videos. The metrics include number of views, likes, dislikes, comments and
apart from that published date, duration and category are also included.

The train.csv file also contains the metric number of adviews which is our
target variable for prediction.
