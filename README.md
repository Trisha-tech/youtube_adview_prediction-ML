# Youtube Adview Prediction




This project named **Youtube Adview Prediction** is designed to build a machine learning regression to predict youtube adview count based on other youtube metrics.

Youtube advertisers pay content creators based on adviews and clicks for the goods and services being marketed. They want to estimate the adview based on other metrics like comments, likes etc. 

The problem statement is therefore to train various regression models and choose the best one to predict the number of adviews. The data needs to be refined and cleaned before feeding in the algorithms for better results.



## ðŸ’¥ Features

- It predicts the youtube adview count based on other youtube metrics using machine learning regression.


## Data Description

The file train.csv contains metrics and other details of about 15000 youtube videos. The metrics include number of views, likes, dislikes, comments and apart from that published date, duration and category are also included.

The train.csv file also contains the metric number of adviews which is our target variable for prediction.
